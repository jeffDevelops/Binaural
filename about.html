	 	<p>Binaural is an aural skills teaching tool for anyone wishing to hone their music theory skills. Being able to accurately and quickly identify intervals is a critical skill for the live musician. It allows you to adjust your tuning on-the-fly, and if you want to improvise with other musicians, identifying intervallic relationships in and between chords is critical to your success in sounding like a coherent musician.</p>

	 		<h1 class="logo_large subheading">Intervals: The Atomic Level</h1>
	 		<p>Students progress from rudimentary intervals in series - one pitch after another - to simultaneous intervals. They will be able to go from recognizing intervals at the middle octave, to intervals anywhere on the keyboard.</p>
			<p>Students will advance from spelling generic intervals to recognizing enharmonic equivalents.</p>

	 		<p></p>
			<p>The aim here is to introduce new concepts gradually, getting students to ask themselves "How many notes am I hearing?" to "What is the quality of the triad I'm hearing?" Building up from root position and eventually to first, second, and third inversion, the exercises in this category are many: differentiating the root, bass, third, and fifth; identifying inversion; and identifying quality. From there, we introduce sevenths and their influence on quality and resolutions.</p>
